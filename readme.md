# CSS In-Class Assignment Instructions

### Class Vs. Tag Specificity Rule

1. Open your HTML-in-class-project
2. Open the styles.css file
3. At the top of the file, write a style rule to turn all h1's blue ![CSS code to turn all h1's blue](/assets/h1-blue.png)
4. Look at your website in the browser
5. In your HTML, find an h1 and add a class attribute with a value of "red-text"
6. Write a style rule in your CSS to turn that element red ![color-red code example](assets/red-h1.png)
7. Which style rule 'won'?

### Inline/Internal/External

1. Using the code examples on the slides, add three different style rules, three different ways (inline, internal, & external)!
   
### As A Group: Dev Tools

Sometimes your browser's Dev Tools can be a great way to try out different rules. Each step in this section should be tried out in the Chrome Dev Tools _before_ you put the working code into VS Code.

- In the Dev Tools, change the first paragraph to green (it's in the form area). Once you have that in the dev tools, add a class to the paragraph in the HTML file and use CSS to make the change permanent in the CSS file.
- In the Dev Tools, change the image in the About Our Products section to have a width of 100 pixels (it's in the form area). Once you have that in the dev tools, add a class to the image in the HTML file and use CSS to make the change permanent in the CSS file.
- Use the Dev Tools to write a rule to change _all_ H1s to a different color. Once you've got working code, write that same rule in your CSS file.
	- Use the dev tools to change all headings (of any size!) to use the font "Times New Roman". Either do them individually, or with a "selector" list, where you separate the selectors with a comma and a space. Now make the change permanent in your CSS fileâ€”you'll definitely want to use a selector list here to save time.
- Using the Dev Tools, make all text in the gallery section a different color. Find a class that you can use to affect the text, then add the rule to your CSS file.
- Using the Dev Tools, make the blue box of text for the certification process section 40% of the viewport height. Find an existing class or selector that you can use to make the same change to your CSS file, then make that change permanent using CSS.

### Border Bonanza - Lab Time
